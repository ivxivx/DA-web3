# Overview
This project contains some practical examples for web3 data analytics, both on-chain and off-chain data, including block, transaction, exchange rate, stable coin, uniswap (liquidity pool), compound (lending and borrowing), etc.


# Requirements:
- Python: 3.11
- An Infura API key is needed to execute most examples; some examples also require a FlipSide API key. Both keys should be added into the .env file.


Pending
- Uniswap V4
- Bridge
